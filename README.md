## Who am I?

I'm a Software Engineer focused on backend systems — not just writing endpoints, but designing APIs that are secure, scalable, and maintainable.

I care about:
- Clean code
- Clear architecture
- Performance
- Security
- Simplicity over hype

If it runs in production, it should be predictable.

## What I Work With

Spring Boot  
Spring Security  
JPA / Hibernate  
MySQL / PostgreSQL  
Microservices  
Redis  
Docker  
Jenkins CI/CD  

I work inside real systems — fixing bugs, improving structure, understanding existing codebases, and making them better.

## Engineering Philosophy

• If it’s complex, simplify it.  
• If it’s messy, refactor it.  
• If it’s slow, measure it.  
• If it’s insecure, fix it.  

Backend isn’t about controllers.  
It’s about systems.

## Current Focus

- Advanced Spring Security  
- Logging & MDC  
- Caching with Redis  
- Production-ready Microservices  
- Writing code I won’t hate in 6 months
