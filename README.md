## My Journey

I didn’t start as an expert.

I started confused.  
Reading documentation slowly.  
Breaking things. Fixing them. Breaking them again.  

Today, I work as a Software Engineer building backend systems with Java and Spring Boot.  
Not perfectly. Not magically.  
But consistently.

Every day I try to understand systems a little deeper than yesterday.

---

## What I Work With

Spring Boot  
Spring Security  
JPA / Hibernate  
MySQL & PostgreSQL  
Microservices  
Redis  
Docker  
Jenkins CI/CD  

But tools are just tools.

What really matters to me is writing code that:
- Someone else can understand  
- Doesn’t collapse under pressure  
- Still makes sense six months later

## What I Believe

Good backend development is not about writing many endpoints.  
It’s about designing systems that behave correctly.

It’s about:
- Thinking before coding  
- Refactoring when needed  
- Taking responsibility when something breaks  
- Growing quietly without noise  

---

## Right Now

I’m focused on becoming a stronger backend engineer.  
Learning deeply.  
Understanding architecture.  
Improving daily.

Not chasing hype.  
Chasing mastery.
