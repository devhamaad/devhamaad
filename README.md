## My Journey

I didn’t start as an expert.

I started confused.  
Reading documentation slowly.  
Breaking things. Fixing them. Breaking them again.

Today, I work as a Software Engineer building backend systems with Java and Spring Boot.  
Not perfectly. Not magically.  
But consistently.

Every day I try to understand systems a little deeper than yesterday.

## Technologies I Work With

### Backend
- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Security  
- JPA / Hibernate  
- RESTful APIs  
- Microservices Architecture  

### Databases
- MySQL  
- PostgreSQL  

### Infrastructure & DevOps (Exposure)
- Docker  
- Jenkins (CI/CD Pipelines)  
- Redis  
- Linux basics  

These are tools I use to solve real problems —  
improving existing systems, fixing production issues, and making applications more reliable.

## What I Believe

Good backend development is not about writing many endpoints.  
It’s about designing systems that behave correctly.

It’s about:
- Thinking before coding  
- Refactoring when needed  
- Writing clean, maintainable code  
- Taking responsibility when something breaks  
- Growing quietly without noise

## Right Now

I’m focused on becoming a stronger backend engineer.  
Learning deeply.  
Understanding architecture.  
Improving daily.

Not chasing hype.  
Chasing mastery.
